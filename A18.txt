Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is among the best-educated in the nation.[12] In recent decades its economy has diversified, shifting from traditional industries such as agriculture and resource extraction to services and finance. While Minnesota's population is still mostly Scandinavian- and German-American, domestic migration and immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America have broadened its demographic profile.
